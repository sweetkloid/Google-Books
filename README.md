# Google-Books
challenge 21

## Description

We wanted to create an app that allows a user to pull up a searched book using google books api. Any user can look up a book. However, the best way to get the full experience of the app is to sign-up. On you sign-up you have the ability to add books to your collection. You can even remove a book you no longer want from your collection.
